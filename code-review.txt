    Users.java
    Projects.java
    Products.java

  2. User Stories:
  - As a project planner, I want a way to know when expenses exceed the budget and adjust accordingly: 
    + In Projects.java class, we have methods that handle tasks like adding expense, get total expenses, and calculate remaining budget.

        public class Projects { 
           private List<Expenses> expenses;
         .
         .
         .
          public void setBudget(double budget) {
        this.budget = budget;
    }

    public List<Expenses> getExpenses() {
        return expenses;
    }

    public void addExpense(Expenses expense) {
        expenses.add(expense);
    }

    public double getTotalExpenses() {
        double totalExpenses = 0;
        for (Expenses expense : expenses) {
            totalExpenses += expense.getAmount();
        }
        return totalExpenses;
    }

    public double getRemainingBudget() {
        return budget - getTotalExpenses();
    }
}
  - As a product user, I want to have a way to set a reminder for an appliance or product to know when something needs serviced or when the warrant is 
  about to expire:
    + In Products.java class, we have an instance field named `warrantyDate` and we have getter, setter methods to insert Warranty infomation. We haven't 
    had time to implement the notification feature yet.
    + Directory:  TCSS360-Green/main/schoodle/src/main/java/Products.java
    + Block of code to review: 
      public class Products {
        private Date warrantyDate;
        .
        .
        .
         public Date getWarrantyDate() {
        return warrantyDate;
    }

    public void setWarrantyDate(Date warrantyDate) {
        this.warrantyDate = warrantyDate;
    }
    }
